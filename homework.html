    <ul id="myTaskList"></ul>

    <hr />

    <input type="color" placeholder="Color" id="colorPicker" />
    <input
      type="button"

      onclick="changeTaskBackgroundColor()"
    />

    <hr />

      /* EXERCISE 5: 
                Add a new task to the list.
                Suggestion:
                - Use document.getElementById to get the UL item and the input text
                - Use the document.createElement to create the new List Item
                - Append the child to the UL
            */

      /* EXERCISE 6: 
                Create a method "removeLast" which removes the last item from the task list
            */

      /* EXERCISE 7: 
                Create a method "removeFirst" which removes the first item from the task list
            */

      /* EXERCISE 8: 
               Create a method "getTasksAsArray" which returns, and prints to the console an array containing the tasks as string
            */

      /* EXERCISE 9:
               Create a method "changeTaskBackgroundColor" which takes the color from the color picker with an 
               onchange event listener ad applies it as background to every list item
            */

      /* EXTRA */

      /* EXERCISE 10: 
               Create a method "bubbleSort()" which sort the task list alphabetically using the bubble sort algorithm
            
               Use your spare time to beautify your task list via CSS.

               Suggestion:
               - Break the code into many function for semplicity 
               - Reuse the functions previously created
